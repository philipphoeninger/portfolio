# Personal Portfolio

Hi, this is my personal web developer portfolio. You can check out my skills and work done outside of my regular job here :star:

## How to build it

TODO ...

## What this project uses / Overview

:small_blue_diamond: Lit
:small_blue_diamond: Web Components

## Concepts & Possibilities

- **Web Components** ðŸ“¦

  This portfolio site is built with web components. For a better developer experience and better overall quality and functionality, the web component framework **Lit** is used. For more on Lit, visit its documentation here: <https://lit.dev/>.

- **Configurable** ðŸ”§

  This portfolio site and the used components are, to a certain extend, configurable. By updating the config.ts file and adding the necessary assets into the respective folder, one can insert his/her own data and information, images etc. and customize the site. All properties to the needed *ConfigModel* are optional, removing the components not specified from the page.
  The general page component then connects all components.
  This portfolio site does not claim to be a completely configurable personal website builder, however, if you like the core design as is, you are invited to download it, tweak it, choose a theme and reuse it for your own portfolio ðŸ™‚

- **Theming** ðŸ”´ðŸ”µðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¤

  If you want to use a specific design instead of enabling users to choose a theme, just specify the theme in the *DataModel*s **theme** property (config.ts) that will then be permanent and unchangeable by users.

- **Localization** ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¦

  This site uses generated and translated .xlf files for localization. If you change the text, you have to do the following for enabling localization: TODO
